- 👋 Hey there, I’m Roshnie. A beginning game designer/artist.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating, writing, and telling stories through games. I love the prospect of designing an entirely different reality in which everything you desire is posible.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about the creative side of game development and practicing these skills by applying them to a current game project I'm working on now. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on story-rich games with teams that seek beginning yet promising talents and wish to grow together!
- 📫 To reach me, shoot me a message on Discord! Username: light.v3
